Original :
--------
micropython-ffigen is experimental tool to generare external library bindings
for ffi/uctypes modules of MicroPython https://github.com/micropython/micropython
from C header files.

micropython-ffigen depends on c2ffi tool (https://github.com/rpav/c2ffi),
which in turn depends on LLVM and Clang (http://llvm.org/).


Now:
----
micropython-ffigen is experimental tool to generate libraries and bindings
lib goes into:
  ${MICROPYPATH}/lib-dynload/_${module_name}-${upy-version}-${TRIPLE or arch}.so

python glue code and module body get concat into:
  ${MICROPYPATH}/site-packages/${module_name}/__init__.py


main goal of this new tool is to ease rebuilding H3Droid sdk and eventually support multiarch.
